  "title": "The Feminine",
  "subtitle": "She moves in spirals, not lines. She births, holds, dissolves, remembers.",

  "archetypeTitle": "The Archetypal Feminine",
  "archetypeText": "More than gender, the feminine is a mode of being. It flows, receives, nourishes, holds paradox. It is moonlight, tides, womb, mystery. It is not weakness, but the power to become space for transformation.",

  "mythTitle": "Myth and Matrix",
  "mythText": "Goddesses, mothers, dark wombs of creation — many traditions hold the cosmos as born of the feminine. Gaia, Sophia, Shekinah, Kali. The matrix is not a machine, but a mother. We are not separate from her.",

  "polarityTitle": "Sacred Polarity",
  "polarityText": "Masculine and feminine are not enemies — they are dancers. Structure and flow, clarity and depth, penetration and presence. When distorted, they clash. When sacred, they co-create.",

  "embodimentTitle": "Embodied Wisdom",
  "embodimentText": "To honor the feminine is to slow down, to feel, to trust the body. It is found in bleeding cycles, creative cycles, death and rebirth. It cannot be grasped — only met, softened into, listened to.",

  "promptTitle": "Contemplation",
  "promptText": "Where does the feminine live in you? What would happen if you listened to her rhythm?"
