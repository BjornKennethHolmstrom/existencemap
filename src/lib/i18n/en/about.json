  "paragraph1": "Existence Map is a poetic framework for exploring consciousness, development, mystery, and meaning. It is not a belief system, but a mirror — one that gently reflects aspects of our evolving inner and outer worlds.",
  "paragraph2": "Inspired by Spiral Dynamics, integral theory, mysticism, and interbeing, this map seeks to orient the soul in an age of complexity. You may find patterns, resonance, contradiction — or simply a reminder that you are not alone in your wondering.",
  "quote": "This is not a map to control the world — but a mirror through which the world awakens itself.",
