  "title": "Timelessness",
  "subtitle": "There is a silence that does not pass. A now that has no edges.",

  "paradoxTitle": "The Paradox of Time",
  "paradoxText": "Time is both real and unreal. It moves us, ages us, orders our lives — yet slips through our fingers. Mystics and physicists alike whisper that time may be a construct, a projection of change — not the fabric of reality, but a veil over it.",

  "flowTitle": "Flow States and Satori",
  "flowText": "In moments of absorption — dance, devotion, danger, stillness — time falls away. These states are not escape, but return. Zen calls it satori: the flash of no-time. The now is not between past and future — it is outside them.",

  "nowTitle": "The Sacred Now",
  "nowText": "Eternity is not endless duration. It is the depth of presence. The now is not a tiny slice of time, but a doorway. It widens as we attend to it. The more we live here, the less we need to control what comes next.",

  "everydayTitle": "Eternity in the Everyday",
  "everydayText": "The eternal reveals itself in small things — a breath, a glance, a bird landing on a branch. To notice fully is to enter timelessness. You don’t have to reach far. Time is not the enemy. But it is not the whole truth.",

  "promptTitle": "Contemplation",
  "promptText": "Where do you meet the eternal in your life? When was the last time the clock disappeared?"
