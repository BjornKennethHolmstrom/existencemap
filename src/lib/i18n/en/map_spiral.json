  "metaphorTitle": "The Spiral as Metaphor",
  "metaphorText": "Growth is not linear. We circle back. We spiral inward, upward, downward, and out again. What seems like return is often transformation. The spiral reminds us that life moves in patterns, rhythms, revolutions — not straight lines.",

  "dynamicsText": "Spiral Dynamics offers a lens to understand human development — not as better or worse, but as adaptive responses to life conditions.<br><br>Each stage has its beauty, shadow, and necessity.

  "humilityText": "Development is not superiority. A child is not less than an adult. A farmer is not less than a scientist. Each way of being serves a moment, a soul, a system. If we must evolve, let us do it with kindness.",

  "chainTitle": "The Golden Chain",
  "chainText": "Some awakenings are so luminous, we want to hold onto them — repeat them. But clinging to a stage, even a spiritual one, becomes its own trap. The spiral invites us to move freely — not wear our growth as armor, but walk with openness.",
