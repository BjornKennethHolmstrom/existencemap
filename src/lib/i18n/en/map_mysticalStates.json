  "subtitle": "Sometimes what we are vanishes — and what we truly are is all that remains.",

  "whatTitle": "What Are Mystical States?",
  "whatText": "Mystical states are altered conditions of consciousness where identity loosens, boundaries dissolve, and a sense of unity, emptiness, or transcendence may emerge. These states defy language — yet leave lasting impressions of truth, beauty, and transformation.",

  "pathsTitle": "Paths That Lead There",
  "pathsText": "Mystical states may arise through stillness, devotion, rhythm, silence, or surprise. Meditation, prayer, breathwork, nature immersion, dance, or trauma — all may open the veil. In ancient traditions, they were cultivated with intention. Today, some also explore them through entheogens like psilocybin, ayahuasca, DMT, and LSD.",

  "examplesTitle": "Examples of Mystical States",
  "examplesText": "There are countless flavors of mystic experience. Here are a few recurring patterns across traditions:",
  "examplesList": [
    "The Eight Jhānas — from blissful concentration to infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and cessation.",
    "Nondual awareness — where subject and object collapse into one luminous field.",
    "Oceanic unity — a sense of being dissolved into all things.",
    "The void — a vast, silent, empty presence beyond form.",
    "Light-body states — perceived radiance or sacred geometry within and around the self.",
    "Entheogenic visions — encounters with archetypes, intelligences, or divine realms beyond waking imagination."

  "stagesTitle": "States vs. Stages",
  "stagesText": "States come and go. Stages remain. A child may glimpse infinity — but cannot yet embody it.",

  "promptTitle": "Contemplation",
  "promptText": "What if the mystical isn’t rare — but always present, just unnoticed? What opens in you when everything becomes sacred?",

  "egoDeathTitle": "The Dissolution of Self",
  "egoDeathText": "Ego-death — also called ego-dissolution or ego-disintegration — is perhaps the most profound and transformative mystical experience. It refers to a temporary state where the ordinary sense of self dissolves, revealing a more fundamental awareness that exists prior to the constructed identity.\n\nIn this state, the boundaries that seem to separate \"me\" from \"not-me\" fall away. What remains is not unconsciousness, but a vast, clear consciousness no longer filtered through the lens of personal identity. The experience is often described as:",
  "egoDeathList": [
    "A merging with everything",
    "Pure awareness without an observer",
    "Being everything and nothing simultaneously",
    "Consciousness without content or center"
  ],
  "egoDeathText2": "Unlike other mystical states which might modify perception while maintaining the perceiver, ego-death fundamentally disrupts the perceiver itself. This can feel like dying—not physically, but the death of who you thought you were.",

  "pathsTitle": "Paths to Ego-Death",
  "pathsText": "This profound shift in consciousness can arise through multiple gateways:",
  "pathsList": [
    "Deep meditation: Particularly in traditions that emphasize emptiness (Buddhism) or non-duality (Advaita Vedanta)",
    "Entheogenic experiences: High doses of psilocybin, LSD, DMT, or 5-MeO-DMT are known catalysts",
    "Breathwork: Holotropic breathing and other intensive respiratory practices",
    "Ekstasis: Ecstatic dance, music, or sensory overwhelm",
    "Near-death experiences: Profound brushes with mortality",
    "Spontaneous occurrence: Sometimes arising without obvious cause"
  ],

  "paradoxTitle": "The Paradox of \"No-Self\"",
  "paradoxText": "The irony of ego-death is that there's no \"you\" left to experience it—at least not in the ordinary sense. As the Zen saying goes: \"Like a snowflake dissolving in air, where does it go? It never truly existed to begin with.\"\n\nYet something witnesses even this dissolution. What remains when \"you\" are gone? Many traditions suggest this is our true nature—consciousness itself, prior to all identification and division.",

  "integrationTitle": "Integration and Return",
  "integrationText": "The return from ego-death often brings profound challenges and gifts:",
  "integrationList": [
    "A visceral understanding of interconnection",
    "Decreased fear of physical death",
    "Shift in values and priorities",
    "The task of living from a wider perspective within conventional reality",
    "Sometimes, spiritual emergency requiring careful integration"
  ],
  "integrationText2": "Perhaps most importantly, ego-death reveals that what we call \"self\" is not a fixed entity but a process—a verb rather than a noun. The ego is not an enemy to be destroyed, but rather a useful tool that can be held more lightly after glimpsing what lies beyond it."
