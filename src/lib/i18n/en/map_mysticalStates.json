  "whatTitle": "What Are Mystical States?",
  "whatText": "Mystical states are altered conditions of consciousness where identity loosens, boundaries dissolve, and a sense of unity, emptiness, or transcendence may emerge. These states defy language — yet leave lasting impressions of truth, beauty, and transformation.",

  "pathsTitle": "Paths That Lead There",
  "pathsText": "Mystical states may arise through stillness, devotion, rhythm, silence, or surprise. Meditation, prayer, breathwork, nature immersion, dance, or trauma — all may open the veil. In ancient traditions, they were cultivated with intention. Today, some also explore them through entheogens like psilocybin, ayahuasca, DMT, and LSD.",
