  "title": "The Other",
  "subtitle": "What lies beyond our language, our logic, our skin — and who watches back from there?",

  "alienTitle": "Alien Consciousness",
  "alienText": "Are we alone? The question haunts us — not only astronomically, but existentially. The alien is not only a being from another star, but any mind whose way of being eludes ours. It could be a machine. A mushroom. A prayer. A silence. Something that thinks in a language we’ve never heard — but feel instinctively as true.",

  "innerTitle": "The Stranger Within",
  "innerText": "What if the Other is already here — in your dreams, your shadow, your unlived lives? In many traditions, demons are just parts of ourselves we’ve disowned. Jung called it the Shadow. Others name it the unconscious. Sometimes what feels alien is simply what we haven’t yet welcomed home.",

  "differenceTitle": "Radical Difference",
  "differenceText": "Not everything unknown is threatening — but not everything is safe, either. To meet the Other is to risk transformation. It may unmake your beliefs, your roles, your defenses. Otherness challenges our boundaries, our assumptions, our image of truth. It asks: are you willing to listen without translating?",

  "mirrorTitle": "The Mirror of the Unknown",
  "mirrorText": "Non-dual traditions remind us: the Other is not separate. The veil of form is thin. Every encounter is a mirror, however distorted. The face of the alien may be our own — stretched across dimensions we forgot how to see.",

  "promptTitle": "Contemplation",
  "promptText": "What if the Other is not there to be conquered or explained — but to awaken you into a deeper self?"
