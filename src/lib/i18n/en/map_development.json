  "title": "Development",
  "subtitle": "We unfold, not to become better — but to become more fully ourselves.",

  "whatTitle": "What Is Development?",
  "whatText": "Development is the gradual unfolding of complexity, depth, compassion, and awareness. It may express through thought, behavior, values, or presence. It is not a ladder — but a flowering. Not a race — but a rhythm.",

  "modelsTitle": "Models of Growth",
  "modelsText": "Various models seek to describe how humans grow over time: cognitively, emotionally, morally, and spiritually. Spiral Dynamics maps these shifts through colors; Integral Theory frames them as developmental lines. These maps do not define us — but they may help orient us.",
  "spiralizeLink": "Explore Spiralize.org",

  "nonlinearTitle": "Nonlinear and Spiral",
  "nonlinearText": "Growth is rarely linear. We return, revisit, spiral, and regress. One stage is not 'higher' than another — each is a vital part of the golden chain of being. Some are more inclusive, others more focused — but all are needed in the great mandala of humanity.",

  "barriersTitle": "Barriers and Catalysts",
  "barriersText": "Growth may be halted by fear, trauma, social pressure, or comfort. It may accelerate through crisis, mentorship, curiosity, or love. There is no right pace. The seed does not compare itself to the flower — both are sacred in their moment.",

  "chainTitle": "The Golden Chain",
  "chainText": "Sometimes, what once liberated us becomes our new cage. In mystic language, this is the golden chain — attachment to insights, stages, or identities we've outgrown. We try to recreate the light instead of walking freely into the unknown. Growth asks for gratitude — and release.",

  "promptTitle": "Reflection",
  "promptText": "Where do you sense your own growth unfolding? What aspects of yourself are being invited to mature — and which are ready to rest?"
