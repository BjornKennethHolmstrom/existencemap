  "title": "Beyond Religion",
  "subtitle": "Not against the sacred — but beyond the walls built around it.",

  "directTitle": "Direct Experience",
  "directText": "Before beliefs, there was breath. Before temples, awe. Many mystics from every tradition found the divine not through dogma, but through direct encounter — in silence, in vision, in surrender. This is not anti-religious, but trans-religious.",

  "dogmaTitle": "Beyond Dogma",
  "dogmaText": "Religion, when rigid, can divide. But at its heart, it seeks union — with the divine, the truth, the self. To go beyond religion is not to reject spirit, but to reclaim it from frozen forms. The sacred does not require an institution.",

  "integrationTitle": "Integration of Paths",
  "integrationText": "Mystics have always crossed borders. Sufis danced, Buddhists sat, Christians wept in caves. Universalists, syncretists, contemplatives — all find light in many lamps. The soul does not care what language it prays in.",

  "namelessTitle": "The Sacred Without a Name",
  "namelessText": "Some truths are too wide for doctrine. Some mysteries dissolve every definition. Beyond religion lies the radiant unknown — not absence of faith, but a deeper kind. The kind that kneels in the forest and forgets its name.",

  "promptTitle": "Contemplation",
  "promptText": "What if spirit has always been with you — not behind a gate, but in the wind, the tears, the breath?"
