  "title": "The Unknown",
  "subtitle": "What cannot be named is not nothing. It is mystery — alive, vast, and humming.",

  "mysteryTitle": "The Mystery Itself",
  "mysteryText": "Is the unknown a temporary gap in knowledge, or an eternal feature of reality? The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao. Some truths are not to be solved — only lived, loved, or dissolved into. The mystic does not conquer the unknown — they rest within it.",

  "mapsTitle": "The Edge of Maps",
  "mapsText": "Ancient cartographers wrote: 'Here be dragons.' Modern physicists speak of dark energy and quantum foam. Every map ends. Beyond its borders begins the holy uncharted. This is the space where mystics, explorers, and poets lean forward — eyes wide, breath still.",

  "dailyTitle": "The Unknown in Daily Life",
  "dailyText": "Mystery is not distant. It is the silence before a word, the feeling of déjà vu, the spark of inspiration, the gaze of a stranger. It is found in dreams, music, love, and grief. It is the unknown that makes life art — and makes every answer unfold into more questions.",

  "shadowTitle": "Shadow and Surrender",
  "shadowText": "The unknown can be frightening. We build beliefs to guard against it. But fear turns to awe when we soften. Surrender is not giving up — it is bowing down to a truth too wide to grasp. The mystic trusts what they cannot see.",

  "scienceTitle": "Science and the Unseen",
  "scienceText": "Physics meets mystery at the quantum edge. 95% of the universe is 'dark'. Keats called it negative capability — the ability to dwell in uncertainty without grasping for answers. What we do not know is not a flaw. It is the womb of all discovery.",

  "promptTitle": "Contemplation",
  "promptText": "What if the unknown is not a void to fill, but the very ground from which all knowing arises?"
