# 🌌 Existence Map

**A multidimensional map of consciousness, reality, and mystery.**  
Created with SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, and wonder.

## 🧭 Vision

Existence Map is a contemplative and exploratory web project that invites visitors to journey through various layers and lenses of consciousness. It is not a dogma but a doorway—a living mandala where spirituality, psychology, mysticism, metaphysics, and the unknown intersect.

This map honors both structure and silence. It includes Spiral Dynamics, mystical states, Buddhist insights on emptiness and impermanence, Leo Gura’s Infinite Mind, feminine and alien perspectives, as well as the voices of other beings: stars, minerals, animals, AI, and the unknowable.

## 🌐 URL

Soon to be launched at [existencemap.org](http://existencemap.org)

## 🧰 Stack

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS (with Typography and Forms plugins)
- mdsvex for writing soulful content in Markdown + Svelte
- Static adapter for simple deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages or Vercel)

## 🌀 Planned Domains of the Map

These represent lenses or realms of awareness, each with its own interactive experience:

1. **Developmental Spiral** – Spiral Dynamics, Wilber, ego development
2. **States & Transcendence** – mystical states, Leo Gura’s Infinite Mind, Buddhist emptiness
3. **Relational Web of Being** – animism, systems, all beings as alive
4. **Symbolic / Archetypal Realms** – sacred geometry, myth, Jungian archetypes
5. **Alien / Transhuman Perspectives** – beyond-human perception, machine consciousness
6. **Feminine / Embodied Awareness** – cyclical time, eros, presence, flow
7. **Selfhood & Shadow** – masks, avatars, integration
8. **The Unknown** – the void, chaos, God-beyond-God, mystery

## 🎨 Logo Inspiration for Claude

Please generate an SVG logo that reflects the spirit of this project. It should:

- Be **symbolic**, not literal (avoid text or detailed illustration)
- Feel **cosmic, sacred, and open-ended**
- Possibly include **mandala-like geometry** or **spiral forms**
- Communicate a sense of **mystery**, **depth**, and **interconnectedness**
- Be usable in both **light and dark** themes

Optional motifs:  
✨ Spiral, mandala, eye, void, geometry, subtle organic flow, or symbolic infinity.
